        <h3>History & Provenance</h3>
        <p>The title **"La Scapigliata"** translates literally as "The Dishevelled Woman" or "The Woman with Messy Hair," a descriptor that captures the drawing's spontaneous, unfinished quality. This work is not a finished portrait but a **sketch in progress**—an oil-on-panel study that demonstrates Leonardo’s working process. It may have been a preparatory study for a lost painting or perhaps an independent demonstration of his artistic capabilities.</p>
        <p>The work's beauty lies in its incompleteness. The delicate rendering of the face contrasts sharply with the swift, energetic execution of the wild, flowing hair, allowing the viewer to witness the transition from precise planning to expressive spontaneity.</p>

        <h3>Technique: The Unfinished Masterpiece</h3>
        <p>Only the face has been meticulously rendered, using **sfumato** to model the features and create soft transitions around the eyes and mouth, lending her a tender, dreamlike quality. The rest of the panel is covered only in a light brown wash, leaving the neck, shoulders, and background undefined.</p>
        <p>The true focus is the **mastery of the hair**. Leonardo captures the sensation of wind and movement, treating the locks not as individual strands but as a dynamic, swirling mass. This contrasts the serene stillness of the face with the visual energy of her unbound hair, a recurring theme in Leonardo’s studies of nature.</p>

        <h3>Subject and Emotional Depth</h3>
        <p>The woman’s expression is introspective and soft, her eyes cast downward, suggesting modesty or contemplation. The unfinished nature of the sketch actually enhances its emotional impact, stripping away the formality of portraiture to reveal the core **human emotion** and form. It is a study of idealized beauty captured at a fleeting moment, characterized by a unique balance between the rough immediacy of the sketch and the finished perfection of the features.</p>
