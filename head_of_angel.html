        <h3>History & Context</h3>
        <p>This exquisite study, often called *Busto di Fanciulla* (Bust of a Young Girl), is a preparatory drawing for the head of the **Angel Uriel** in Leonardo’s famous altarpiece, *The Virgin of the Rocks*. Executed in black chalk with white highlighting, it demonstrates the crucial role drawing played in Leonardo’s painting process: resolving form, light, and expression before applying brush to canvas.</p>
        <p>The drawing's purpose was to establish the ideal head form and the precise effects of light that would be used in the finished oil painting, demonstrating the scientific rigor underlying his artistry.</p>

        <h3>Technique: Modeling with Light and Shadow</h3>
        <p>The study is a breathtaking example of **chiaroscuro** (the use of strong contrasts between light and dark) to achieve three-dimensional volume. Leonardo uses the black chalk and subtle blending to create deep shadows, while the white chalk highlights catch the light on the forehead, nose, and chin. This careful **modeling** transforms a flat sheet of paper into a sculpted, living form.</p>
        <p>The delicate, downy strands of hair and the gentle, idealized features convey the serene and other-worldly nature required of an angelic figure. It is a testament to his ability to blend anatomical accuracy with aesthetic perfection, achieving an almost luminous quality.</p>

        <h3>Idealized Form and Expression</h3>
        <p>The angel's face is characterized by its **idealized beauty**—a flawless, symmetrical form typical of the Renaissance pursuit of perfection. The downcast gaze and slightly parted lips suggest a moment of quiet contemplation or communication. This study is less about capturing a specific person and more about rendering the perfect *idea* of celestial youth and grace, using light and shadow as the primary emotional tools.</p>
