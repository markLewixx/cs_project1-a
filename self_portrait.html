        <h3>History & Context</h3>
        <p>This drawing is the most widely recognized image of Leonardo in his later years. Created in red chalk on paper, the work likely dates from the period when he was living in Rome or traveling to France shortly before his death. While the title suggests it is a **self-portrait**, some scholars argue it might be an idealized portrait of a philosopher or even a study for an Apostle. However, its striking resemblance to later descriptions of the master, particularly his long hair and beard, make it a powerful symbol of the aging genius.</p>
        <p>It was first cataloged as a self-portrait in the 19th century and has since become the definitive visual representation of the Renaissance master, capturing the depth of his intellect and his venerable age.</p>

        <h3>Technique: The Power of Line</h3>
        <p>Executed using **red chalk** (*sanguine*), the technique demonstrates Leonardo's mastery of drawing as an independent art form. Unlike the soft, blended glazes of his oil paintings, this medium relies on precise lines and cross-hatching to create form and shadow. The drawing is a magnificent study in texture, defining the curling hair, the flowing beard, and the heavily furrowed brow.</p>
        <p>The intensity of the subject's gaze suggests a profound inner life and wisdom. The lines around his eyes and mouth convey fatigue and knowledge, providing a rare and intimate glimpse into the persona of one of history's most private thinkers.</p>

        <h3>Interpretation: The Renaissance Mind</h3>
        <p>The portrait embodies the ideal of the **Renaissance intellectual**. The strong, steady lines and the weight of the expression suggest a man burdened by vast knowledge and endless curiosity. The drawing's simple yet powerful composition, set against plain paper, compels the viewer to focus entirely on the subject’s face—a direct confrontation with the mind behind the greatest artistic and scientific achievements of the age.</p>
