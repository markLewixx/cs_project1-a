        <h3>History & Provenance</h3>
        <p>This portrait, painted during Leonardo’s second Milanese period, features a prominent sitter, likely one of the women at the court of Ludovico Sforza. The traditional name, **"La Belle Ferronnière,"** arose from a misidentification in the 17th century, mistakenly linking the portrait to a fictional mistress of King Francis I of France who was the wife of an ironmonger (*ferronnier*). Art historians believe the sitter may be Lucrezia Crivelli, another mistress of Sforza.</p>
        <p>The portrait’s attribution to Leonardo himself has sometimes been debated, but its sophisticated composition, handling of light, and the sitter's penetrating gaze generally confirm its status as an authentic masterpiece from the master or his workshop, created under his direct supervision.</p>

        <h3>Ornamentation and Formal Composition</h3>
        <p>The sitter is defined by her elaborate attire and, most notably, the **"ferronnière"**—the fine jewel worn across her forehead. This ornamentation contrasts sharply with the plain, dark background, drawing immediate attention to her features and wealth. The portrait is a rigorous example of a half-length figure shown behind a **parapet** (a low wall), which acts as a barrier separating the sitter's world from the viewer's.</p>
        <p>Unlike the *Mona Lisa*, here Leonardo uses a more defined contour. The sitter's intense, almost severe gaze and the bold, geometric presence of the parapet create a sense of imposing **formality and distance**. Her profile is sharp and well-defined by the crisp light that falls across her face and the deep shadows on the left.</p>

        <h3>Psychological Depth</h3>
        <p>Despite the formal composition, the woman's expression conveys a profound psychological presence. She is reserved yet fully engaged, with an unwavering confidence. The deep, rich reds and gold tones in her dress suggest luxury and status, while the fine details in the lace and the jewel testify to Leonardo's obsessive attention to texture and detail. The overall effect is one of quiet authority and aristocratic poise.</p>
