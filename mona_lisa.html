            <h3>History & Provenance</h3>
            <p>The **Mona Lisa** is arguably the most famous painting in the world. It is widely believed to be a portrait of **Lisa Gherardini**, the wife of Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo, hence its Italian title, *La Gioconda*. Leonardo began the portrait in Florence around 1503 but never fully delivered it to the patron. He carried it with him to France in 1517 when he entered the service of King Francis I, who later acquired the work. This personal attachment and continuous refinement by Leonardo contributed to its near-mythical status even before its global fame.</p>
            <p>The portrait’s journey from a private commission to a royal treasure, and ultimately to a state-owned artwork in the Louvre, cemented its permanent place in public consciousness. Its theft in 1911 and subsequent recovery two years later made headlines worldwide, turning it into a truly modern cultural icon.</p>

            <h3>Technique: Sfumato and the Enigmatic Smile</h3>
            <p>The captivating and mysterious quality of the *Mona Lisa* stems from Leonardo's masterful use of **Sfumato**. This technique involves allowing tones and colors to shade gradually into one another, producing soft, hazy outlines and a subtle atmospheric effect. Leonardo achieved this by applying numerous layers of thin oil glaze, so delicate they are almost transparent.</p>
            <p>This subtle layering is most famously utilized around her mouth and eyes. The hazy transition from shadow to light blurs the exact line of her smile, allowing it to appear differently depending on where the viewer focuses. When you look directly at her mouth, the smile seems to vanish; when you look at her eyes, the smile seems to deepen, creating the famous **"enigmatic smile"** that has puzzled viewers for centuries. </p>

            <h3>Subject & Interpretation</h3>
            <p>Beyond the sitter's identity, the painting is celebrated for its revolutionary psychological depth. Leonardo broke from the traditional profile or three-quarter poses of his time by having Lisa engage directly with the viewer. Her relaxed posture and her hands resting gently over one another convey an unprecedented sense of **intimacy and naturalness**.</p>
            <p>The background, a fantastic and seemingly impossible landscape, contributes to the painting’s emotional ambiguity. The misty, mountainous vista, created using **aerial perspective**, contrasts sharply with the sitter's presence, suggesting a union between the human form and the vastness of nature—a concept central to Leonardo’s philosophy.</p>
