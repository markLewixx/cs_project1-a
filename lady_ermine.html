        <h3>History & Provenance</h3>
        <p>This striking portrait depicts **Cecilia Gallerani**, a young woman at the court of Milan and the mistress of Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, who was Leonardo's patron at the time. Painted during Leonardo's first Milanese period, this work showcases his evolution from the static poses of Florentine portraiture. It is one of only four surviving portraits of women painted by Leonardo.</p>
        <p>The painting was likely commissioned to celebrate Cecilia's new relationship and the birth of her son. The direct, almost intimate connection between the sitter and the viewer, combined with the dynamic movement of the animal, makes this an unparalleled work of the early Renaissance.</p>

        <h3>Symbolism and Composition</h3>
        <p>The **ermine** held by Cecilia is highly symbolic. In ancient texts, the ermine was revered for its purity, as it would supposedly rather die than soil its white coat. The animal also directly references Ludovico Sforza, as he was a member of the prestigious Order of the Ermine. Thus, the ermine functions as a clever and sophisticated visual pun, clearly identifying the sitter’s powerful lover without stating it explicitly.</p>
        <p>Compositionally, the work is masterful. Leonardo uses a **contrapposto** (counterpose) effect: Cecilia's body turns to the left while her head turns sharply to the right, mirroring the tension in the ermine's posture. This creates a sense of momentary pause and elegant restlessness, bringing a profound **psychological dimension** to the portrait.</p>

        <h3>Technique: Light and Contours</h3>
        <p>Unlike the misty background of the *Mona Lisa*, the background here was originally a dark blue-grey (though later repainted black). This dark void makes Cecilia and the ermine emerge dramatically, emphasizing the effect of the light. The light source strikes her from the upper right, exquisitely sculpting her face, hands, and the animal's powerful form, highlighting the delicate folds of her dress and the translucent quality of her skin. The precision of the **anatomical study** in the ermine demonstrates Leonardo's dedication to scientific observation, even within portraiture.</p>
